# **QBuddy: A Tempo-Driven Listening Experience ** ðŸŽ¶  

QBuddy began as a creative tool to generate the perfect Spotify queue, briefly ventured into synchronized lyrics visualization, and has now evolved into a **digital stereo system** that **bounces to the beat of your music**.  

This project has always been about one thing: creating a unique, immersive music experience. From crafting seamless playlists to syncing animations with a songâ€™s heartbeat, QBuddy continues to evolve in exciting ways.

## **The Journey**  
1. **Creative Queue Generator**  
   Originally, QBuddy aimed to craft intelligent Spotify queues, blending tracks seamlessly based on factors like tempo, mood, and genre.  

2. **Lyrics Visualization**  
   After Spotify deprecated key Web API endpoints on November 27, 2024, QBuddy pivoted to synchronized lyrics. For two weeks, it offered animated falling lyrics aligned with music playback.  

3. **Digital Stereo System**  
   The project ultimately found its rhythm by focusing on syncing visual effects to the **tempo of music**, delivering a deeply immersive experience.
